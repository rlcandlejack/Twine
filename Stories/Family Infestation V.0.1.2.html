Welcome to @@.embold;Family Infestation@@, an interactive novel all about alien parasites, impregnation and breeding. Throughout the course of the story you&#x27;ll be encountering a great deal of sexually explicit material, featuring bodily transformation, bestiality and incest. If you don&#x27;t want to read about or see any of that then I suggest you leave now. If you&#x27;re not old enough to view sexually explicit content in whatever country you&#x27;re viewing this from then please close this tab.

She&#x27;s recently turned eighteen and is just about to finish her final year of secondary school. Next comes her first big step into adulthood: university. She&#x27;s hoping to study English Literature at Saint Mary&#x27;s College in Durham, a prestigious establishment that demands top grades and success in a string of high-pressure interviews. Now that the exams are over and the coursework is all handed in, there&#x27;s nothing much left to do but wait.

Do you want to see what she&#x27;s doing [[right now|intro2]]?

Or perhaps you&#x27;d like to know a little bit more [[about her|ettapro]]?


</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="intro2" tags="" position="704,1140">Today is the last day of term. As @@.e;Etta@@ climbs aboard the double-decker bus she can&#x27;t help but respond to the excitement in the air; summer, that near-timeless stretch of chance and possibility, is just around the corner. The bus is absolutely packed, the air already thick with the scent of bodies, but @@.e;Etta@@ sees @@.l;Lily@@ waving manically from the back.

You should [[listen in|intro3]] to what they have to say to each other.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="ettapro" tags="" position="570,997">@@.e;Etta@@ is a fairly ordinary girl, without much to distinguish her from the other students at college save for slightly above average academic performance. She&#x27;s kind and open, with a generous heart and a desire to please and bring goodness into the world. She has a passion for reading, particularly science-fiction, and her hobbies include playing video games, going to the cinema, and hanging out with her friends at the park.

Like many teenagers, @@.e;Etta@@ isn&#x27;t entirely happy with the way she looks; she has, for instance, long given up the hope that the meagre buds of her flat little breasts will ripen and bloom into the soft and pillowy mounds she assumes all boys crave to get their hands on. She&#x27;d also be lying if she said that she&#x27;d never wished that her bottom was a little smaller and her hips a little narrower. But, for the most part, @@.e;Etta@@ manages to not let such minor issues get the better of her; there&#x27;s no point in fretting about things that can&#x27;t be changed, is there?

Our @@.e;Etta@@ isn&#x27;t the most popular girl at school but she&#x27;s not quite at the bottom of the pile either. This, she realised a few years back, isn&#x27;t so much to do with her own inherent qualities but more due to the lasting influence of her big sister, @@.mo;Molly@@. Back when she was a student at Lovelock High she&#x27;d been the reigning queen of the upper crust, the social elite of the student body. @@.e;Etta@@ knows this and is grateful for the protection such a legacy affords her and her friends because school, as you no doubt know, can be a harsh environment for the weak and isolated. Despite this, however, @@.e;Etta@@ often wishes for a chance to strike out on her own, to forge her own way through life.

Oh, and she&#x27;s a virgin, but don&#x27;t tell her I told you so.

But enough of that. Let&#x27;s see what she&#x27;s doing [[now|intro2]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="lilypro" tags="" position="571,1142">25.
@@.e;Etta@@ and @@.l;Lily@@ have been friends since kindergarten and they&#x27;re about as close as it&#x27;s possible to be without actually being related. She&#x27;s what most people would call a goth, favouring dark, extravagent clothing and equally dark make-up. She pulls it off well, exhibiting a style that would look right at home in a Sisters of Mercy video. Her outlook, however, is anything but dark; with her blonde hair, usually worn up in pig-tails, and her big smile, she&#x27;s much too bubbly to really fit the stereotype.

Unlike @@.e;Etta@@, @@.l;Lily@@ has amassed a considerable amount of sexual experience. Girls, boys, even both at the same time, @@.l;Lily@@&#x27;s appetite for fucking would put even a porn-star to shame. She has a particular penchant for older men, a taste she satisfies at the many late-night music gigs she attends. It&#x27;s no secret, but she isn&#x27;t, and never will be, affected by gossip.

I know what you&#x27;re thinking. You want to know whether her and @@.e;Etta@@ have ever &lt;em&gt;done anything&lt;/em&gt;? A worthwhile question, but I&#x27;m afraid the answer is no. Even after countless sleepovers and shared changing rooms, the spark of sexual attraction has never so much as flickered between them.

Let&#x27;s get back to the [[bus|intro3]], shall we?

@@.l;Well@@, @@.l;remember that man@@... And so Etta listens dutifully while @@.l;Lily@@ recounts another tale of debauchery. She&#x27;s beyond the point of being jealous of her friend&#x27;s activities, despite her own inferiority when it comes to matters of the flesh. @@.e;Etta@@ isn&#x27;t that bothered about her yet-unspoiled virginity; she&#x27;s saving it, at least she hopes, for when it&#x27;ll truly mean something to lose. It&#x27;s obvious that @@.l;Lily@@ has long since left behind such sappy notions. For her it&#x27;s not about love, nor intimacy; she&#x27;s in it for the pleasure and nothing else.

The bus ride is long but @@.l;Lily@@ has a lot to say. Less than a month in the future is the Class of &#x27;97 Summer Leavers Camp, the big send off for all graduating students. She&#x27;s so excited she can barely sit still.

@@.l;I can@@&#x27;@@.l;t believe it@@&#x27;@@.l;s finally here@@, she cries. @@.l;Just think about it@@: @@.l;evening strolls through the woods@@, @@.l;sunbathing by the lake@@ - @@.l;I got a new bikini especially that I can@@&#x27;@@.l;t wait to show off@@. @@.l;Have you ever been skinny dipping@@? @@.l;I have@@. @@.l;It@@&#x27;@@.l;s so fun@@, @@.l;Etty@@, @@.l;you@@&#x27;@@.l;d love it@@.

The Leavers Camp is in the lakelands; it&#x27;s a beautiful part of the country, full of dense forests, gently rolling hills, and, as the name suggests, lakes. It&#x27;s supposed to be purely recreational but the school organises enough activities to keep even the most restless teens busy: rounders, athletics and football for the sporty types, and things like bushcraft, hiking, and orienteering for the more thoughtful sorts. @@.l;Lily@@, judging from the way she&#x27;s talking, isn&#x27;t interested in any of those options; she&#x27;s much more concerned about which members of the faculty she&#x27;ll get to see in [[their swimming costumes|intro4]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="intro4" tags="" position="702,1390">@@.l;I can almost see it@@, she says over the raccous noise of the surrounding kids. @@.l;Mr@@. @@.l;Jackson in his tiny little Speedos@@. @@.l;Now that@@&#x27;@@.l;s something to look forward to@@.

@@.e;Eurgh@@, @@.e;That@@&#x27;@@.e;s gross@@, exclaims Etta. @@.e;He@@&#x27;@@.e;s so old@@! @@.e;Can you imagine how hairy he is@@?

@@.e;Etta@@ immediatly blushes. She elbows @@.l;Lily@@ in the ribs and says, @@.e;Be quiet@@! @@.e;Someone might hear you@@. @@.e;You know that was just the drink talking@@.

@@.l;Whatever you say@@, @@.l;girl@@. @@.l;You aren@@&#x27;@@.l;t fooling me@@.

@@.e;I can@@&#x27;@@.e;t believe you even remembered that@@. @@.e;You haven@@&#x27;@@.e;t told anybody@@, @@.e;have you@@?

@@.l;Of course I haven@@&#x27;@@.l;t@@. @@.l;Who do you think I am@@?

It goes on like that for a little longer, @@.l;Lily@@ teasing @@.e;Etta@@ about her crush on their form tutor, one young teacher named @@.t;Miss Timms@@. Only last week, after helping consume a few bottles of wine round at @@.l;Lily@@&#x27;s place, @@.e;Etta@@ had let slip that she often fantasised about her during class. @@.l;Lily@@, of course, had jumped at the chance.

Despite the topic of the Leavers Camp dominating their conversation, @@.e;Etta@@ can&#x27;t quiet bring herself to tell @@.l;Lily@@ that she won&#x27;t be going. Shes known this fact for some time but hasn&#x27;t yet found the right time to tell her. It&#x27;s about money, obviously. @@.e;Etta@@&#x27;s mother, @@.m;Helen@@, says there&#x27;s just no way they can make the finances stretch that far. @@.e;Etta@@, being the sweet girl that she is, didn&#x27;t kick up a fuss. She knows how hard her mother works just to put food on the table and clothes on their backs.

The bus shudders to a stop outside of the school gates. @@.e;Etta@@ and @@.l;Lily@@ shoulder their bags and [[head to class|intro5]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name="intro5" tags="" position="696,1518">The two girls make their way through the throngs. Like on any last day of term, the school seems more like a zoo than anything else; kids yell and whoop as they charge across the quadrangle and tear along the corridors. If it were any other day you&#x27;d catch a glimpse of the menacing figure of @@.a;Mrs@@. @@.a;Appleford@@, the gym teacher, wading through the chaos and dishing out detentions as if they were going out of style. Today, however, she&#x27;s nowhere to be seen.

@@.e;Etta@@ and @@.l;Lily@@ reach their form room and find their seats. The other students file in gradually and soon the classroom is abuzz with chatter. One boy, Luke, smiles at @@.e;Etta@@ as he passes her desk; she immediatly blushes and looks away.

@@.l;There@@&#x27;@@.l;s a rumour that he likes you@@, whispers @@.l;Lily@@. @@.l;I heard he@@&#x27;@@.l;s hoping to get to know you better at camp@@.

Before @@.e;Etta@@ can answer, @@.t;Miss Timms@@ arrives. @@.t;Good morning everyone@@, she says. Even though most of the other teachers have made the most of the last day in order to dress more casually, she&#x27;s dressed in her usual ensemble: a black, hip-hugging pencil skirt and a white blouse open at the neck, the latter tight enough to more than emphasise the heavy swell of her chest. Today is a particularly hot day and there&#x27;s a tiny rivulet of sweat running down her slender neck and into her cleavage. As she sits at her desk and starts to unpack her file, @@.e;Etta@@ can&#x27;t help but stare. She pushes her glasses up her nose and addresses the class: @@.t;settle down guys@@. @@.t;The sooner we get this done@@, @@.t;the sooner we can get out of here@@.

The class, bitten by the summertime bug, is rowdy, so registration takes a little longer than usual. When the task is finally complete, @@.t;Miss Timms@@ bids the class farewell, adding that she&#x27;s looking forward to seeing everyone at camp. @@.e;Etta@@ sighs regretfully, knowing that she&#x27;s going to be missing her only chance to see @@.t;Miss Timms@@ in her bathing gear. 

As the class files out, she stops @@.e;Etta@@.

What could [[she want|intro6]]?</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="intro6" tags="" position="833,1000">@@.t;Etta@@, @@.t;I@@&#x27;@@.t;ve been meaning to speak to you for some time@@.

@@.e;Etta@@ tells @@.t;Miss Timms@@ that she&#x27;ll think about it, but inside she feels like she&#x27;s about to burst. A chance to meet with her in casual setting, probably out of the confines of the school? There&#x27;s no way she&#x27;s going to pass on such an opportunity.

@@.t;Miss Timms@@ didn&#x27;t always want to be a teacher. After graduating with a first class degree in Classics from Trinity College, Oxford, she pictured herself carving out a successful career in the world of publishing. As a young girl she&#x27;d fostered a feirce love of books, and, although such a passion often breeds a desire to write, she found herself longing to spend her working life as a part of the establishment that made such love possible for people all over the world.

After a brief spell at home, she packed her bags and set out for the Big Smoke, London, that ancient and ever-growing metropolis, the home of the British publishing industry.

Six months into her internship, however, and @@.t;Miss Timms@@ was starting to realise the truth. The industry wasn&#x27;t how she&#x27;d imagined it; it was harsh, callous and cutthroat. With her moral sense outraged and her resolve crumbling, she began to panic. Had she been chasing the wrong ambition all this time? Not only that, but she was lonely; even in a city as crowded and bustling as London, she felt her isolation keenly. Gradually everything fell apart.

She fled the city, returning home to Lancashire to be welcomed lovingly by her parents. Instead of wallowing in defeat, @@.t;Miss Timms@@ took control. Wasting no time, she embarked upon a P.G.C.E. teacher training scheme and, through a startling series of conincidences, ended up with a job at the school of her youth, Lovelock High. Life had knocked her back, true, but @@.t;Miss Timms@@ had a new resolution. She would guide her students along the rocky road towards adulthood, cultivating in them a love of knowledge for its own sake. Time will only tell whether or not she will find success.

@@.a;Mrs@@. @@.a;Appleford@@ is the terror of Lovelock High. Dubbed @@.a;The Countess@@, her cruel and callous ways have gained her the fear of students and staff alike; even the Head Teacher cowers before her. Although nobody would dare say it to her face, the common theory is that she&#x27;s not actually a &#x27;Mrs&#x27; at all, but lives alone as a spinster, growing more and more bitter in her loneliness with each day. With no husband to nag and belittle, she takes her frustrations out on the students.

The truth, of course, is a little more complex than that. Like @@.t;Miss Timms@@, she began her career planning to make a difference. A vibrant young woman, she hoped that her efforts would change the lives of her students; her dream was to be that one teacher they remembered in later life, the one that believed in them and pushed them towards success.

As the years went by, however, her ideals started to wane. Confronted by year after year of working tirelessly for the benefit of apathetic students and hampered at every corner by an inefficient bureaucracy that seemed to function only to oppose her efforts, she began to grow disillusioned. Soon it wasn&#x27;t the bureaucrats and politicians in the department of education that were the targets of her anger, but the students she taught. As class after class shrank before her baleful eye, her terrible reputation was set. 

Save for the monster on the surface, nobody has a clue about @@.a;Mrs@@. @@.a;Appleford@@ and the sad, repressed and defeated woman within.

Feel a little more sympathetic now? No? Ah well, time for [[detention|intro9]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="30" name="intro9" tags="" position="828,1386">The rest of the day passes without much notice. The day&#x27;s classes barely deserve the name. Nobody is in the mood to learn and it&#x27;s not just the students either; the teachers themselves are winding down for the summer, content to let their classes deteriorate into something near to anarchy. Almost everyone is talking about the leaver&#x27;s camp. @@.e;Etta@@ tries her best not to let it bother her but by the end of the day she can&#x27;t help but feel fed up.

The final bell trills out in the hallway and the classrooms explode open; doors slam back on their hinges and once again chaos reigns as the students, free at last, spew out of the building and out into the sunshine.

@@.e;Etta@@ lags behind. A few of her classmates, Luke included, try to get her to come with them to the shopping precinct but she fobs them off with vague excuses. She can&#x27;t miss the detention, even if it isn&#x27;t exactly deserved. Although she knows @@.a;Mrs@@. @@.a;Appleford@@&#x27;s threats are probably empty, she&#x27;s never been one to take risks; who knows, @@.a;The Countess@@ might have far-reaching influence after all, and @@.e;Etta@@ doesn&#x27;t want to leave having gotten on her bad side.

So, like the good and proper girl she is, @@.e;Etta@@ dutifully reports to @@.a;Mrs@@. @@.a;Appleford@@&#x27;s office, a dingey cupboard of a room next to the sports hall. She swallows her apprehension and taps on the frosted glass window set into the door.

The sound of shuffling comes from within. @@.e;Etta@@ waits a moment and is about to knock again [[when|intro10]]...</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="31" name="intro10" tags="" position="828,1511">@@.a;Yes@@? @@.a;Who is it@@? Her voice, even though muffled by the closed door, is as strident as ever.

@@.e;Etta@@ opens the door and steps inside. The office is dark and smells strongly of furniture polish. The blinds are closed and the only light comes from a lampstand in the corner of the room. @@.a;Mrs@@. @@.a;Appleford@@ is sitting at her desk, a large leatherbound book open before her. She narrows her eyes as she stares at @@.e;Etta@@.

@@.e;I don@@&#x27;@@.e;t know@@, says @@.e;Etta@@, hoping the tremor in her voice doesn&#x27;t sound too much like fear. @@.e;We weren@@&#x27;@@.e;t together in the last class and I came straight here when it ended@@.

@@.a;Mrs@@. @@.a;Appleford@@ closes the book and then cracks her knuckles in a single deft motion. @@.a;I@@&#x27;@@.a;m not surprised@@. @@.a;That friend of yours has always been trouble@@. @@.a;No respect for authority and responsibility@@. @@.a;Life will not be good to her@@, @@.a;you mark my words@@.

Her lips are pursed, so tight they&#x27;re almost white.

@@.a;I am not here to &lt;em&gt;get to know&lt;/em&gt; anybody@@, she says slowly. @@.a;My job is to ensure that you all have the necessary training to prepare you for the real world@@. @@.a;Once you leave this school you@@&#x27;@@.a;ll realise that world doesn@@&#x27;@@.a;t care a jot whether or not you@@&#x27;@@.a;re &lt;em&gt;kind&lt;/em&gt;@@.

@@.e;Etta@@ is about to retort and tell the old battle-axe that it&#x27;s not all that bad, but thinks better of it. Who is she to lecture a grown woman on what life is really like?

@@.a;Well don@@&#x27;@@.a;t just stand there@@. @@.a;I@@&#x27;@@.a;ve prepared lines for you@@. @@.a;Sit at that desk and do not say a word until you are finished@@.

@@.e;Etta@@ does as she&#x27;s told. She sits at the tiny desk in the corner of the room. The chair is hard and uncomfortable, forcing her to sit upright with her back straight. There&#x27;s a pile of paper sheets, size A4, on the desk, the first of which has the phrase &lt;em&gt;I must at all times respect my superiors&lt;/em&gt; written along the top. Lines? But she&#x27;s eighteen, almost an adult. Writing lines is for kids. She turns around to see @@.a;Mrs@@. @@.a;Appleford@@ glaring directly at her.

@@.e;Etta@@ gathers her things and stands so quickly that she knocks over her chair. The noise, in the silence of the office, sounds like a gunshot,  She turns in time to see @@.a;Mrs@@. @@.a;Appleford@@ frowning at her. Mumbling an apology, she makes for the door.

@@.e;Etta@@ has no idea what to say. She meets @@.a;Mrs@@. @@.a;Appleford@@&#x27;s stare but can do only that. She has no other way to challenge such relentless pessimism. She finally nods, swallowing the lump in her throat as she does.

@@.a;That is all@@, finishes @@.a;Mrs@@. @@.a;Appleford@@. @@.a;You may leave now@@. @@.e;Etta@@ does not need to be told twice. She flees the office, almost forgetting to close the door behind her in her hurry.

She wanders across the empty grounds, seeing only a few other students and the old caretaker. It&#x27;s eerie to see a place usually so profuse with activity nearly deserted, almost like a ghost town. Normally when this sort of thing happens @@.e;Etta@@ would go to the reception and ask the woman behind the desk if she could call home for a lift. Tonight, however, @@.e;Etta@@ knows this isn&#x27;t an option. @@.m;Helen@@ is working late and @@.mo;Molly@@ is out for the evening with her best friend, @@.j;Jules@@.

Apart from getting a lift home with a stranger, the only option available to @@.e;Etta@@ is to walk home but after @@.a;Mrs@@. @@.a;Appleford@@&#x27;s advice, that doesn&#x27;t seem like such a great idea. @@.e;Etta@@ shivers; @@.a;The Countess@@ may have been exaggerating, trying to put the fear into her, but she cannot deny the earnest look the older woman had in her eye when warning her about the dangers of the world. With such thoughts swirling through her mind, @@.e;Etta@@ decides to walk.

The quickest way home is to cut through the woods behind the school. That way leads to the park and it&#x27;s only a short walk from there to the suburban street where @@.e;Etta@@ and her family live. It&#x27;s a pleasant afternoon and there&#x27;s plenty of time until the sun will start to set. @@.e;Etta@@ sets out with a spring in her step, happy to chance upon some time to be truly alone with her thoughts.

Soon @@.a;Mrs@@. @@.a;Appleford@@ and her severe advice are far behind her. As she walks through the trees, her thoughts flit from subject to subject. University, her family, the leaver&#x27;s camp, and, of course, @@.t;Miss Timms@@. In actual fact, the more she thinks about her, the harder it is to stop, especially now that she has a chance to see her again, even if it is within the context of education. Perhaps there&#x27;s something in what @@.l;Lily@@ said: now that school is out of the picture, anything could happen.

The woodland is thick, the canopy obscuring much of the daylight. What light does get through appears in slanting shafts that reveal the whirling dance of bugs and other particulates. The air is rich with the scent of the mulchy decay taking place all around her. Oddly enough, however, the forest is silent; no sounds, not even the sounds of birds or the chirruping of insects, greet her ears. The remaining springtime proliferation of growth has all but covered the trail and @@.e;Etta@@ feels the snag of thorns on her clothes as she pushes on through.

She hears a sudden snap and the rustling of leaves coming from behind her. [[What was that|intro13]]?</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="34" name="contents" tags="" position="828,757">Of all the thousands of names, words whispered in as many different tongues, none can truly describe them.

For eons they have voyaged, their starting point the very origin of the universe. With infinite patience they drift from star to star, driven by a need, a hunger, older than time itself. They seek those planets, glowing like beacons in the black void of space, that bear the sweetest fruit: life!

Countless worlds they have consumed, adding the genetic wealth they harvest to an already unfathomably rich archive. Their neverending quest has seen the downfall of mighty system-spanning civilisations and intricate biospheres. Noble species resist them, invariably fooling themselves that they fight for life itself. They struggle bitterly with fire and science, but in the end they always fall. Nothing is spared, no single creature, no single cell; all is consumed, absorbed.

&lt;em&gt;Homo Sapiens&lt;/em&gt;. You are being watched. They see all you do on that watery globe you call Earth. They see all your scurrying, your frantic to-ing and fro-ing. For too long you have sat upon your lofty throne. They, the ultimate expression of universal life, are coming for you. With rumbling stomach and gaping maw, they are coming for you.

[[This is |titlescreen]]...</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="35" name="titlescreen" tags="" position="702,878">(@@.embold;There will be a big title screen here in future releases. For now, use your imagination ;)@@)

[[Begin|intro1]]...</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="36" name="intro13" tags="" position="960,1256">High up in the canopy a creature is watching @@.e;Etta@@ as she makes her way through the forest. It is a strange being, obviously not of this world. Its body is long and fleshy, beginning at a blunt snout and tapering down to thin tail that flickers back and forth. It grips its perch with a series of limbs tipped with bony hooks. Close to its snout these limbs are long and multi-jointed but as its body thins they become shorter and shorter until they appear as nothing but spines along the length of its prehensile tail. The creature is a hunter, a being engineered specifically to prowl this environment, to stalk and track, following its prey with unwavering concentration.

The organism, a Progenitor is one of many similar creatures, alike in type but all designed with a specific environment in mind. They form the vanguard, the advanced scouts, of a much greater force. Their mission is simple but fraught with danger: they must find a host creature and multiply through any means available. So far, for this particular specimen, there have been few opportunities. The lifeforms that inhabit the woodland are small and skittish, leading solitary lives that do not suit the requirements of the hunter. It needs to find a social creature to use as a host in order to work effectively. It knows vaguely that this planet is populated by a species of advanced carbon-form bipeds that live in close-knit social groups, ideal breeding stock, but until now it has yet to encounter any.

It has been waiting for weeks now, alert to the approach of a suitable target. Cut off from the beings that bred and sent it on its mission, it roamed tirelessly before settings its current ambush. Patiently, the hunter persists; with food all around it and the wealth of ages in its cells, it can afford to move slowly.

But now, with the scent of the @@.e;young woman@@ kick-starting its instincts, the hunter [[prepares to strike|intro14]].
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="37" name="intro14" tags="" position="960,1381">@@.e;Etta@@ shakes her head to dispel her fright and moves on. Just an animal of some sort going about its business in the undergrowth, no doubt. Just because she can&#x27;t see them, doesn&#x27;t mean nothing lives here. 

The trail has started to clear somewhat as the surrounding trees begin to thin out. Here the ground slopes away and down into a wide ditch with a shallow stream trickling along its base. Gripping roots and tough grass, @@.e;Etta@@ carefully makes her way down the slope. She hops over the stream and starts to climb the opposite bank. This proves a much more difficult task; the slope is steeper and the resulting vegetation more sparse. After trying and failing on a few attempts, @@.e;Etta@@ decides to find a point further along the ditch that might provide her with an easier climb.

As she plods along she starts to ponder over her plans for the Summer. With almost four months until university, provided she gets the grades, that is, she has a lot of time to kill. First of all, she&#x27;s looking forward to taking some time to wind down and catch up with her reading now that there&#x27;s no school work to demand her attention. There&#x27;s the group @@.t;Miss Timms@@ suggested but she can&#x27;t see that happening more than once a week. @@.e;Etta@@ knows from previous experience that the freedom of the Summer break can easily slip into languid boredom and seeing as Lily will be away for a few weeks at the leaver&#x27;s camp there&#x27;s a risk of that happening. Thinking further, she comes to the conclusion that she might as well get a job. As she considers further, a range of possibilities dawn on her. She&#x27;s never earned her own money. If she did, it would be hers to use as she saw fit. Of course she&#x27;d help out her mother and Molly with the housekeeping, but the majority of it would be hers, right? She could always put it towards a university living fund, but she could also buy as many clothes and books as she wanted.

As @@.e;Etta@@ grows more excited, a breeze agitates the thin canopy above, the branches and leaves swishing with a sound like waves on a beach. &lt;em&gt;Summer is going to be great&lt;/em&gt;, she thinks to herself happily, unaware that alien senses are [[following her every move|intro15]].



</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="38" name="intro15" tags="" position="956,1506">The alien creature leaps from bower to branch, employing all of its innate abilities to trail the @@.e;girl@@ and remain undetected. Her scent is even stronger now, her animal stench acting like a homing beacon onto which the hunter is locked. The situation couldn&#x27;t be more in its favour; having scrambled down into the sunken stream bed, the @@.e;prey@@-@@.e;animal@@ has sealed its fate. Unable to climb back up the sides, there is only one direction in which to flee.

The hunter strikes, pouncing from a low-hanging branch as the @@.e;girl@@ passes beneath. The attack hits its mark, knocking her forwards so she lands with a thud and splash into the muddy stream. Immune to her screams, the creature wraps the longest six of its limbs around her torso. She&#x27;s covered in a thin layer of flimsy material, not part of her body, and it is difficult to grasp.

The @@.e;girl@@ is unexpectedly strong and is putting up much resistance. She writhes and bucks, yelling hoarsely as she reaches back to claw madly at her attacker. She rolls onto her back and arches her spine, her arms flailing to send mud, water and woodland debris in all directions. The creature can feel the @@.e;girl@@&#x27;s heart beating madly inside her chest, can smell the rich odour of her terror. Her hands grip its body as she lurches forwards onto her knees. 

Aware that it musn&#x27;t harm this potential host, the creature decides to put an end to the struggle. Its flat snout parts to reveal a trio of fangs, their poisoned tips ready to deliver their load. With a quick snap it sinks the needle like points into the nape of its prey&#x27;s neck, pumping a hefty dose of potent neurotoxin into her bloodstream. It releases its grip and leaps away, leaving the poisoned @@.e;girl@@ to flap the last of her energy into the dirt.

The creature watches as her movements become weaker and less frantic. She falls to the side and rolls over onto her belly, her arms stretched out and her fingers reaching for help that will not come. The report of her tumultuous heartbeat gradually ebbs and a moment later she is [[still|intro16]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="39" name="intro16" tags="" position="1090,1000">The successful hunter waits, biding its time in case the @@.e;girl@@ is not fully immobilised. It may be fast but its specialised body is vulnerable; one lucky strike from this plucky animal could be enough to cause fatal, mission-ending damage. After some minutes, when it is clear that the poison has done its work, the creature crawls closer.

It mounts her fleshy rump, clinging to the soft material that covers her body. The scent of fear is now pungent, but the @@.e;girl@@ is helpless, trapped and with nothing to do but accept her fate. The creature insinuates its way under her coverings, tearing and slashing to make room. Once in position, its snout at the base of her spine and its tail at her neck, it wraps its longer limbs around her torso in a tight embrace. The Progenitor organism is ready to meld.

The tip of its tail flickers, the skin peeling back to reveal a waving mass of tiny, filament thin tendrils. The tendrils tickle and probe at the @@.e;girl@@&#x27;s neck, causing tiny hairs to stand on end. The tendrils twist together, forming a sharp point that traces a line up and down the vertebrae, hunting for the perfect spot. The creature, in a sudden motion that causes the paralysed @@.e;girl@@ to spasm, drives the point into her spine,  piercing the skin and penetrating the hard wall of her muscle.

The filaments immediatly disengage from their penetrative form and begin to search out nerves with which to bond. Her eyelids flicker and a steady stream of drool escapes her mouth. She is awake and conscious, alert to but unable to stop what is being done to her. As time passes, the creature fuses with the @@.e;girl@@, its body chemistry synchronising with hers as it taps into her nervous system. Her memories, complete with linguistic context, become part of its knowledge. It knows that her given name is @@.e;Etta@@, that she has existed in this form for eighteen of this planets orbital movements; she&#x27;s on the edge of adulthood, the peak of sexual maturity. It recognises that she exists as an important node in a complex social network, with family, friends and associates aplenty. Her body is strong and capable, her sexual organs operating at optimum efficiency. The Progenitor&#x27;s insticts were right; she will make an [[excellent host|intro17]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="40" name="intro17" tags="" position="1090,1138">Soon the Progenitor organism has near total influence over @@.e;Etta@@&#x27;s motor functions. It requires great concentration, but it bids her to stand. She walks, albeit rather stiffly, further along the stream bed until the banks become less steep and she can be manoeuvered back into the woodlands.

@@.e;Etta@@, after everything, the attack, the sedation and the subsequent loss of control, is only dimly aware of the movements forced upon her. She feels no pain at the invasion, nothing but an unsettling sense of dislocation, as if trapped in a vivid but incongruous dream. Too stunned to feel fear any longer, she can only ride it out, [[a passenger in her own body|intro18]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="41" name="intro18" tags="" position="1088,1263">Eventually @@.e;Etta@@ and her new companion reach her home. She looks a total mess, which isn&#x27;t surprising given what she&#x27;s been through; her clothes are ripped and muddy, while her hair has picked up numerous twigs and leaves.

For the Progenitor, this will prove to be the most dangerous part of the whole symbiotic process. In order to fully fuse with its host, it must allow itself and the potential host to sleep. During this period it will form a permanent attachment, creating the lasting bond it needs. Once this is achieved it can begin to produce the eggs it will lay inside her. If it is caught before this can happen, its mission will be over.

The front door is unlocked so @@.e;Etta@@ has no trouble getting inside. True enough, the Progenitor struggles at first to use her fingers, but after a few fumbling attempts the door is open. From inside come the sounds of other people, movement and communication. There are two voices coming from further inside; one belongs to @@.m;Helen@@, @@.e;Etta@@&#x27;s mother, and the other, @@.mo;Molly@@, her sister. The Progenitor knows this because @@.e;Etta@@ knows this.

Using @@.e;Etta@@&#x27;s memories, it quickly plots a course to her bedroom, the place that belongs to her and, therefore, should be safe. She crosses the dark space of the front room but, before she can reach the stairs, encounters a small warm-blooded quadruped. This is Rocket, a dog, the household pet. After sniffing at her ankles the animal backs away. It growls, a low and gutteral sound. Alerted by the menace of this new threat, the Progenitor sends @@.e;Etta@@ lurching into action. She stumbles up the stairs noisily.

@@.m;Etta@@? @@.m;Is that you@@? comes a voice from below. @@.m;Where have you been@@?

The Progenitor ignores the voice and sends @@.e;Etta@@ crashing through her bedroom door. She lands heavily on her bed, the sounds of footsteps following behind. Using the last ounce of its strength the Progenitor pulls its host to her feet and steers her over to close the door. She manages to block the entrance, shutting out her mother before she can see her. She slumps down to the ground, her back against the door.

@@.m;Darling@@? @@.m;What@@&#x27;@@.m;s the matter@@? Just in time. @@.m;I@@&#x27;@@.m;ve made lasagne@@. @@.m;Do you want any@@?

The Progenitor knows it must reply. It has aroused too much suspicion already and to remain silent [[could prove deadly|into19]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="42" name="into19" tags="" position="1085,1388">@@.e;I@@. @@.e;am@@. @@.e;OK@@, says @@.e;Etta@@, her voice flat and halting.

@@.m;Are you sure@@, @@.m;sweetheart@@? @@.m;You don@@&#x27;@@.m;t sound too good@@.

@@.e;Busy@@. @@.e;day@@. @@.e;Need@@. @@.e;to@@. @@.e;sleep@@.

@@.m;But what about dinner@@? @@.m;You can@@&#x27;@@.m;t go to bed without eating anything@@.

The Progenitor catches the scent of the older woman through the door. Hers is a mature odour, the smell of an animal past its prime. A certain inflection, however, tells the creature that she has promise none the less. Having borne children of her own, her body should be more than receptive to future impregnation.

@@.e;I@@. @@.e;have@@. @@.e;already@@. @@.e;eaten@@. @@.e;Please@@. @@.e;I@@. @@.e;need@@. @@.e;rest@@. @@.e;I@@. @@.e;will@@ @@.e;see@@. @@.e;you@@. @@.e;tomorrow@@.

@@.m;OK@@, @@.m;honey@@. @@.m;But do come down and get some if you change your mind@@. @@.m;It would be lovely to see you@@.

@@.m;Helen@@ leaves, her slippered feet reporting softly on the carpeted stairs. @@.e;Etta@@ hears her greet the dog affectionately. Exhausted, she climbs back into bed, barely managing to lift herself up onto the mattress. She shuffles under the duvet, not bothering to shed her tattered clothes, and wraps the covers tightly around her body. The Progenitor allows her muscles to relax as it prepares her for rest..

Suddenly, the door [[barges open|intro20]] and light from the landing spills into the room...</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="43" name="intro20" tags="" position="1086,1513">@@.mo;Hey sis@@! @@.mo;What@@&#x27;@@.mo;s the big idea@@? @@.mo;I thought we were celebrating tonight@@? @@.mo;I brought us wine@@.

It is the sister, @@.mo;Molly@@. The Progenitor stirs and prepares to respond, causing @@.e;Etta@@ to stiffen.

@@.e;I am too tired@@, she says, the words coming easier this time.

@@.mo;Oh@@, @@.mo;come on@@, groans @@.mo;Molly@@. @@.mo;Don@@&#x27;@@.mo;t be such a big baby@@.

The young woman steps closer and her powerful aroma rouses the creature instantly. Here is the scent of a powerful will, a dominant spirit. There are hints of confidence and overt sexuality, a mind bent on controlling others. She will be a difficult animal to overpower, but a very useful tool once successfully infested.

@@.mo;You sound weird@@, @@.mo;Ett@@. @@.mo;What@@&#x27;@@.mo;s the deal@@?

@@.e;Nothing@@. @@.e;Please let me sleep@@.

@@.mo;Are you high@@?

@@.e;Of course I am not@@.

@@.mo;You@@&#x27;@@.mo;re high@@, @@.mo;aren@@&#x27;@@.mo;t you@@. She laughs, a high and piercing sound. @@.mo;I always knew it was a matter of time@@. @@.mo;Well@@, @@.mo;don@@&#x27;@@.mo;t let me spoil your fun@@.

@@.mo;Molly@@ leaves, slamming the door behind her. [[Alone at last|intro21]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="44" name="intro21" tags="" position="1088,1647">For hours the Progenitor delays the sleep that will complete the melding process. The sounds of laughter and the smell of cooking food float up from downstairs; it feels @@.e;Etta@@ respond to those traces of her family, but there is nothing she can do to break the control. Eventually the house falls silent as both women retire to their rooms.

Finally confident that nothing will disturb it, the Progenitor puts @@.e;Etta@@ into a state of deep, near comatose, rest. It then sets about restructuring her nervous system, rerouting and splicing it with its own. She will now view the creature riding on her back as a part of herself, an intimate organ whose existance she will not share with a soul.

The Progenitor prepares itself prepares for the next stage of its development: the production of eggs. It will lay these eggs inside its host to gestate, her body providing the safety and nutrients they need. In the meantime, it will send @@.e;Etta@@ out in to the world, breaking down the boundaries of sexual propriety that exist between her and others, paving the way for the formation of an efficient breeding colony.

Its energy spent on the production of eggs, the Progenitor will not be able to control its host directly. To break her remaining resolve and dismantle her inhibitions, it will have to be subtle.

Soon, both lifeforms, for now separate, are deep asleep. Come morning they will be one. [[Phase one|p1-1]] of the infestation is about to begin...</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="45" name="disclaim" tags="" position="2589,1851">This is the end of content for now! @@.embold;THANK YOU@@ for playing and I hope you&#x27;ll return to see what comes next.

Day 1 of the first phase of infestation is complete. How did you do? Whether willing or not, @@.e;Etta@@ is now full of worm-goo. In less than a day&#x27;s time her body will be ready for its first clutch of eggs. But what about everyone else? Will @@.e;Etta@@ find a way to charm Rocket? And what of her @@.mo;Molly@@&#x27;s trip to the spa? The keys to shed, and many other secrets, remain hidden ... for now.

Our girl isn&#x27;t broken yet. The Progenitor has work to do. Day 2 will see the stakes be raised to new heights, while @@.e;Etta@@&#x27;s besieged morals sink to even greater depths.

Just what the hell did she do last night? She suddenly recalls her secret and reaches back to check...phew, it’s still there, whatever it is. The thing on her back is still gripping her tightly, its articulated arms reaching round to her belly. Not even vaguely troubled by her inexplicable hitchhiker, @@.e;Etta@@ gets out of bed.

The smell of coffee and bacon comes wafting from downstairs and sets her stomach rumbling.

@@.e;Etta@@ takes a deep breath and picks herself up from the floor. She totters slightly, her legs still unsteady from that power of her orgasm. Her belly grumbles loudly as she takes her dressing gown from the wardrobe; it’s definitely time for breakfast. She tidies up her hair, brushing out the twigs and leaves (&lt;em&gt;I wonder how they got there&lt;/em&gt;? she wonders).
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;
Roused by the scene of bacon and coffee, @@.e;Etta@@ puts on her dressing gown and heads downstairs. She feels ravenous, as if she hasn’t eaten in days, and hopes her mother has made extra; it is the first day of the holidays, after all.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;
Downstairs in the kitchen she finds that her mother has $indeed prepared a feast. There are eggs, bacon, sausages, fried mushrooms, not to mention freshly brewed coffee. The smell is delicious and as @@.e;Etta@@ approaches the breakfast bar she immediately begins to salivate.

Her @@.m;mother@@’s unsupported breasts hang gloriously and for a moment she can do nothing but stare. She feels the arms around her belly squeezing gently; almost simultaneously her pussy grows wet and she is faced with the overwhelming desire to plunge her face into that heavenly divide.

Aside from the bed, desk, and wardrobe, the main items of furniture are three huge bookshelves that contain all of @@.e;Etta@@’s expansive library. From literary greats to pulp stars, veritable tomes to flimsy bestsellers, her collection appears indiscriminate. On a closer inspection, however, it is clear that she has a keen interest in science-fiction.

Like most teenagers, @@.e;Etta@@ has covered her walls with posters. Again, these displays point towards an eclectic taste. A quick look round and you’d notice the stern visage of Judge Dredd staring down from the wall, while on the opposite wall the mournful Lady of Shalott sits in her gondola. Over the desk are arrayed a range of posters depicting black metal bands, their jagged fonts entirely at odds with her sunny disposition.

&lt;em&gt;March 6th 1997

Last night I dreamed about @@.t;Miss Timms@@ again. She was in the garden with mum… They were pruning the rose bushes, only she was naked. Not mum, obviously. I mean @@.t;Miss Timms@@. Mum didn’t seem to notice and neither did she. It was as if it was the most natural thing in the world to be doing that. I was watching them from my bedroom window and I could hear them laughing together. It was deeply erotic. She would bend down without an ounce of shame and I could feel myself getting hotter and hotter. Then mum turned round and waved me downstairs. Of course I went, but when I got out into the garden she was gone. @@.t;Miss Timms@@ came over to me and asked if I wanted to get some ice cream. Her face, her voice, her expression; they were all perfect. I said yes, so we went inside. 

I woke up soon after that. Oh, you would not believe how wet that dream made me. I had to touch myself or I’d never get back to sleep. School today was awful. I thought it would never end. @@.l;Lily@@ got herself into another after hours detention and because we’d planned to go into town together I had to wait. I was standing about in the quad when I saw @@.t;Miss Timms@@. I tried to remain unseen but she spotted me and came right over. She wanted to know about my university applications. Good God, I could hardly speak. All I could think of was ice cream!!!&lt;/em&gt;

[[Send Etta down for breakfast|p1-2]].

[[Check the mirror|mast1]].
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="53" name="mast1" tags="" position="1375,1799">@@.e;Etta@@ approaches the body length mirror that hangs on the door of her wardrobe. She inspects herself, twisting her body from side to side. She wriggles out of her skirt and lets the torn garment fall to her ankles before kicking it away. Next off comes her ripped top until she’s wearing nothing but her bra and knickers. She runs her fingers over the chitinous arms that reach round from behind and feels them flex, tightening ever so slightly in response to her touch. A frisson runs down her spine and sets her extremities tingling.

She turns to the side and sticks out her bottom to better see her passenger. She can see it moving, the smooth plates of its body expanding and contracting. Then she reaches back to feel the point at which its tail joins to the bottom of her neck. When her fingers touch the spot the muscles in her groin spasm and her legs become weak. 

Her vision blurs as she sinks to her knees in front of the mirror. With both hands against the cold surface her breath comes heavily. She feels a wetness spreading between her legs and soon her panties are sodden. The desire for release comes heavily, as if nothing else in the world matters, and her skin burns with lust. Barely in control, she lets her hand drop to her pussy and runs a single finger tip over the gush soaked fabric covering her. Her toes clench and her hand against the mirror balls involuntarily into a tight, white fist. She runs the point of her tongue over her top lip, tasting the sweat that is now pouring from her brow. With a barely stifled grunt she slides aside her soiled knickers and plunges two fingers into her hungry snatch. There’s no resistance, her pussy is so wet it could probably take a fist. With her thumb pressing against her hard clit, she pumps away at herself, each squelching thrust of her hand bringing her closer to climax. Faster and faster she goes, pushing herself towards the precipice. 

@@.e;Oh yes@@, @@.e;oh yes@@, she squeaks, coming suddenly. A feeling like nothing else floods over her body, expanding like a ball of heat in her belly and flowing into her limbs. Her whole body contracts as if to contain the force of her orgasm. 

@@.e;Oh my God@@, she pants, as the climax ebbs away. @@.e;That was amazing@@! She tries to stand but her legs are shaking. In the mirror she sees that her breast has flushed bright red and then she notices the arms twitching around her belly. She feels pleased with herself, as if she’s just achieved a goal of some sort. Finally managing to haul herself up, she kicks off her now filthy panties. Time to get on with the day!

The day is turning out to be glorious, bright and sunny but with a pleasant breeze. She passes a number of people, some washing cars or mowing lawns and others just relaxing, all of them dressed for summer. She greets the people she recognises and smiles at the ones she doesn’t. Her spirits are high and she can’t help but feel lucky that she lives in such a wonderful neighbourhood. If only she could get a little bit closer to people … a little bit more intimate ...

Just as she’s nearing the bus stop she sees an old man tottering down the street with two dogs, a big doberman and a border collie. He’s wearing a long beige coat, despite the weather, and there is a grey fedora atop his head. It’s @@.s;Mr@@. @@.s;Shaw@@, the local eccentric. He lives a few doors down from @@.e;Etta@@ and her family, alone with his dogs. The story goes that he used to be a teacher at Lovelock High but was kicked out less than a year shy of retirement for groping a student. There wasn’t any proof but to prevent a scandal they fired him, as quietly as possible, without an investigation. Since then he apparently does nothing but wander around with his dogs, always dressed in his spy-coat and silly hat.

@@.e;Good morning@@, @@.e;Mr@@. @@.e;Shaw@@, says @@.e;Etta@@ sweetly as he passes.

@@.s;Good day@@, @@.s;young miss@@, he says, lifting his hat in an exaggerated manner. @@.s;Such a fine day for a stroll@@, @@.s;don@@&#x27;@@.s;t you think@@? @@.s;How wonderful it is to feel the sunshine on your face@@.

@@.e;It certainly is@@. @@.e;Off anywhere in particular@@? @@.e;Etta@@ is momentarily alarmed as @@.s;Mr@@ @@.s;Shaw@@’s dogs congregate around her, sniffing inquisitively. She gingerly strokes Jackson, the big male doberman, trying her best to avoid his long sloppy tongue.

@@.s;Oh heavens no@@, he laughs. @@.s;I@@’@@.s;m just taking in the air@@. @@.s;There@@’@@.s;s nowhere for an old man like me to go these days@@.

@@.e;Etta@@ isn’t sure exactly how old @@.s;Mr@@. @@.s;Shaw@@ is but he looks fairly ancient. His face is peppered with liver spots and his hair, although by no means thin, is a brilliant white. He’s also blind, having lost his sight to cataracts, and although his animals aren’t trained to act as guide dogs, he maintains that they’re good enough for him.

@@.s;And what about you@@? @@.s;What does the day hold in store for you@@?

@@.e;Etta@@ tells him about her plan to find a job and help contribute towards the family finances.

@@.s;Marvellous@@, he cries. @@.s;Not like some of your contemporaries@@. @@.s;Awful layabouts the lot of them@@. @@.s;Far too content to sit and let the time whittle away@@. @@.s;Well@@, @@.s;when it@@&#x27;@@.s;s all gone they@@&#x27;@@.s;ll be sorry@@. 

@@.e;Etta@@ starts to wonder just how she might be able to get out of this. @@.s;Mr@@. @@.s;Shaw@@ can be a real talker once he gets going.

Checking over her shoulder and listening out for any movement downstairs, @@.e;Etta@@ decides that it’s safe to search her @@.m;mother@@’s room.

Looking through the dressing room drawers, she finds an assortment of cosmetic items, makeup, skin and hair care products. There are also sanitary items, wet wipes, tampons, and pads.

The wardrobe is full of clothes that haven’t been worn in a long time. There are beautiful gowns and blouses, smart trousers and daring mini-skirts. &lt;em&gt;What a shame @@.m;Mum@@ doesn’t get a chance to wear these anymore&lt;/em&gt;, thinks @@.e;Etta@@.

Before calling off the search she has a quick rummage through the clothes on the ground. They’re mostly the jeans and plain shirts @@.m;Helen@@ wears for work but there are also quite a few pieces of underwear. @@.e;Etta@@ picks up one of the bras that support her @@.m;Mother@@’s colossal breasts and gapes in awe. She holds it against her own chest and sighs … &lt;em&gt;Maybe one day&lt;/em&gt;. Next she scoops up a pair of panties. She quickly glances over her shoulder as a bizarre compulsion hits her. Should she take the panties?

She opens the book, flicking through the pages until she’s at the most recent entry, dated from only two nights ago. @@.mo;Molly@@’s handwriting is messy, a slap-dash scrawl, but not entirely indecipherable:

&lt;em&gt;Dear Diary:

I’m sorry it’s been so long since my last entry, but I was away with @@.j;Jules@@, remember. I thought about taking you with me but I knew I wouldn’t get time to write. 

The cottage was lovely, right on the edge of Dartmoor, miles away from the closest village. At night it was so dark that we could see the stars like never before. @@.j;Jules@@ has only ever known the city, so she was dumbstruck by the beauty of the unpolluted night sky. On the first night we lay out on the decking for hours and I showed her the constellations I knew.

We spent a long time walking the moors, following trails and barely meeting another soul. There were a few walkers, mainly aging couples or solitary old men, and they were always polite and greeted us warmly. I hated seeing them; they ruined the illusion of isolation that I needed so badly. @@.j;Jules@@ seemed less bothered by these intrusions, and was keen to strike up conversation&lt;/em&gt;.

The entry goes on and on like that, with @@.mo;Molly@@ describing the moors and her many thoughts as her and @@.j;Jules@@ hiked through the days. @@.e;Etta@@ started to think that she wouldn’t find anything interesting, but then she turned the last page and bingo! 

&lt;em&gt;It happened again on our last night. We actually hadn’t drunk much of the wine we’d brought with us so we decided the have a blow-out and finish the lot. I can’t remember who moved first, but before I knew what was happening @@.j;Jules@@ was kissing me, or I was kissing her - I can’t be sure. It all happened so quickly. In a matter of seconds we were both naked and I was on my back before the fire, my legs spread and @@.j;Jules@@’s tongue in my pussy. God dammit, I promised myself I wouldn’t let it happen again. How I supposed to make her see that I only want to be friends when I keep on finding myself between her thighs?&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $pchar.cor eq 2&gt;&gt;
As @@.e;Etta@@ reads the diary she imagines the scene described. She pictures her @@.mo;sister@@’s naked body, her cries as @@.j;Jules@@ feasts on her wet cunt. She grows excited and her hand starts to waver around her own pussy. Is it wrong to be turned on by such thoughts? It takes all of @@.e;Etta@@’s willpower to close the book and slip it back into the box. Perhaps she can use this knowledge to her own ends? And what other secrets dirty little secrets are hiding underneath @@.mo;Molly@@’s squeaky clean exterior? 
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;
@@.e;Etta@@ closes the diary. @@.e;I knew it@@, she whispers to herself. She slips the book back into the box, pleased with herself for digging out such juicy information. Who knows when such knowledge will come in handy!

She strips out of her clothes and climbs into the cubicle. 

Under the stream of hot water she soaps herself up, massaging the creamy lather into her skin. She shivers in near bliss as the water cascades against her back. Her passenger squeezes her, showing its appreciation for the care its host is taking. It decides a little reward might be in order ...
&lt;&lt;if $pchar.cor gte 4&gt;&gt;
By this point the Progenitor is well on the way to breaking down the barriers that stand between it and effective use of its host. Her readiness to masturbate and the interest she has already shown in the other members of her family is very promising indeed. Perhaps now is the time for a little direct intervention?

Slowly as not to startle her, the Progenitor lifts its flat snout from the small of her back. A small mouth-like slit opens and from within projects a thick and slime-slick tentacle. While she rubs shampoo into her hair it injects a large dose of alien hormones into her bloodstream. Struck unawares by a sudden desire to fuck, she tears the shower head down from its holder and rams it against her pussy. Then, just as she starts to buck her hips, the Progenitor slips its tentacle tongue between her thighs, sliding between her parted lips. Extending further, it insinuates its way between the gushing showerhead and her body, rubbing its flat, puckered tip against her clit. It flaps back and forth, mercilessly teasing the hot little nub. In response @@.e;Etta@@ drops the shower head; it clatters against the wall and dangles from the hose, spraying water over @@.e;Etta@@’s chest as she drops to her knees.

The Progenitor plants its tongue firmly against her clit, enveloping and taking it inside. As it sucks and sucks @@.e;Etta@@ can barely contain herself. She cries and yelps, unaccustomed to such extreme pleasure delivered in such a strange way. She comes once, and then again and again, each time more strong than the last. Still the Progenitor continues its activity, the thick width of its tongue throbbing lewdly between @@.e;Etta@@’s pussy lips. The multiple orgasms arrive in regular waves until @@.e;Etta@@ can no longer stand it. She flops into the base of the shower, her body twitching pitifully with each crash of impossible sensation. Eventually the Progenitor stops; it lets go of her clit, reeling back its tentacular tongue.

@@.e;Etta@@ climbs shakily to her feet. She gingerly fingers her clit and is shocked to find that it appears swollen and engorged; it’s sensitive to the touch and even the tiniest poke sends a shock, not altogether unpleasant, through her body.

She grins to herself, feeling an immense gratitude towards the bizarre hitchhiker on her back. With her heart bursting with affection, @@.e;Etta@@ finishes up in the shower.

She rubs and humps, the foamy water frothing around her groin. With a twist of the shower nozzle she ups the pressure; @@.e;Etta@@ groans with lust as the water pounds her pussy with an even greater force. She leans back against the soapy tiles behind her, holding the head firmly against her snatch as she thrusts her hips forward, grunting bestially with each hump.

Finally @@.e;Etta@@ comes. A torrent of girly gush sprays from her pussy and blends with the water as a cry of strangled joy bursts from between her lips. She spits the wet hair out of her mouth and straightens herself up. She’s going to have to wash all over again now!

She chooses a short denim skirt and an orange strappy top and slips out of her dressing gown. She appraises herself in the mirror, taking in her pale skin, her pert little breasts and pointed nipples. Maybe she can get a boyfriend along with the job? An older one, perhaps.

@@.e;Etta@@ brings the dildo back out of the box.

It doesn’t smell of her @@.mo;sister@@’s pussy anymore, not after she sucked it all off earlier that morning. It’s a real shame but @@.e;Etta@@ has different plans this time around.

She opens her legs slowly, exposing her already sopping wet cunt. The tip of the mammoth plastic cock feels good between her pussy lips as she sweeps it up and down in long sweeping motions. Each time it rubs against raw clit, a little trickle of juice dribbles out of her and runs between her buttocks. She pictures @@.mo;Molly@@ doing the same thing and with every second her desire grows. @@.e;Etta@@ knows that her lust for her @@.mo;sister@@ is shameful, but right now she doesn’t care. If only @@.mo;Molly@@ were here now, then she’d get a real taste of depravity.

@@.e;Etta@@ finally builds up the courage to put the fake cock inside of her. She takes a deep breath and pushes hard. The dildo, lubricated by her liberally flowing pussy juice, slides right inside, penetrating her virgin pussy and filling her out entirely. For a moment she daren’t move, daren’t breath, and just lies there. Then, taking things slowly, she begins to slide the tool in and out. She’s so wet that there’s barely any friction, but the width of the thing and the tightness of her pussy mean that she feels everything. Faster and faster she goes, her body writhing in bliss. &lt;em&gt;Slap!&lt;/em&gt; @@.e;Etta@@ brings her other hand down against her clit. &lt;em&gt;Slap! Squelch! Slap!&lt;/em&gt; She rubs and swipes, swirling her fingertips against her hard little nub. 

Holding on tight while she bucks and thrusts, the Progenitor prepares a dose of hormones that will further increase @@.e;Etta@@’s sensitivity. Just as it detects the slow build of synaptic activity that signifies the onset of an orgasm, it injects the dose. The resulting effect of the alien chemicals on @@.e;Etta@@’s nervous system are explosive; her vision blacks out as the the neuro-electrical fireworks short circuit her visual cortex. No longer in control of her actions, she is lost in a maelstrom of pleasure. Her body continues without her direction, her hands continuing to pump away at her pussy with astonishing vigour. The muscles in her pelvis convulse and a torrent of sticky girl cum jets from her pussy with such pressure that it crosses the room and splatters messily against the mirror.

@@.e;Etta@@ opens her eyes. It’s over. She sits up slowly and looks around. Wait a minute. &lt;em&gt;What am I doing on the floor?!&lt;/em&gt;. She lies back, giggling in delight. That was incredible! Even the dull aching throb of her well-used pussy can’t suppress her delight.

Not only is it huge, but it belongs to her @@.mo;sister@@, meaning that it has, without a doubt, been in her vagina (and goodness knows where else). She brings it to her nose and gives it a delicate sniff; is that the faint smell of pussy she can detect?

She’s about to put it back when the Progenitor tightens its grip around her belly, as if telling her to go ahead. But she can’t use a dildo that’s been inside @@.mo;Molly@@, that’s gross. But then again, is it really that bad? It’s not like it’s wet or anything. Surely it’s no worse than using the same towel or sharing clothes, right? 

@@.e;Etta@@ shrugs and gives the tool another sniff. That’s definitely pussy, @@.mo;Molly@@’s pussy. She runs her tongue over the tip, flicking and licking while she deftly fingers herself with her other hand. Then she opens her mouth wide and in it goes. She slurps and slurps, sucking lewdly at the illicit toy as if it were a lollipop. &lt;em&gt;If only I could taste that pussy too&lt;/em&gt;, she thinks to herself, no longer caring at how perverse that sounds. With drool running down her chin, she sucks away at @@.mo;Molly@@’s dildo until she brings herself to a surprisingly potent orgasm.

@@.e;Etta@@ can only half-heartedly agree as she feels the hot moisture of the dog’s breath against the sensitive flesh of her inner thighs. She bites her lip to suppress a moan as the canine tongue, wet and warm, slaps against her panty-clad pussy. She closes her eyes just as Missy, clearly not wanting to be left out, joins in the feast. Lost in her growing desire, she slides her hand down to her belly and slips aside her panties, revealing her pink pussy. Missy and Jackson hungrily lap up her flowing juices as she sinks her fingers into the flesh of her thighs until her knuckles turn white.

What the dogs lack in technique they certainly make up for in enthusiasm. Their tongues are long and supple, sliding all the way from @@.e;Etta@@’s anus up her clitoris in single, messy strokes. She feels the preliminary rumblings of an orgasm and prepares herself for what is sure to be a real bone-shaker.

From here it’s only a short walk to the high street, the place where all the coolest shops, cafes and restaurants are. She’s feeling pretty good about her chances and is looking forwards to seeing what options are available to her. 

As she gets closer to the centre, the crowds start to thicken. @@.e;Etta@@ looks around cautiously, suddenly aware of her secret. She reaches back, checking that her clothes fully cover the thing she can’t let anyone see. &lt;em&gt;It’s OK&lt;/em&gt;, she tells herself firmly. &lt;em&gt;Nobody will find out&lt;/em&gt;. She takes care, all the same, doing her best to appear inconspicuous, just part of the crowd.

She spends a considerable amount of time checking out the surrounding shops. There are quite a few with staff vacancies, so she can afford to be judicious in her decision making. A lot of her friends at college complain to no end about how much they hate their shitty jobs and @@.e;Etta@@ certainly doesn’t want to join in; she’s going to make sure that whatever job she picks is the right one for her. She speaks to the different shopkeepers, making sure to get as much information as she can: shift patterns, wages, potential benefits. If only her @@.m;mother@@ could see her being so grown up!

Eventually she whittles the decision down to two options: 

There’s the Rainbow Boutique, a cute little clothes shop owned and run by an aging woman named Mary, and a family owned coffee house called Spirella’s.

Which will @@.e;Etta@@ choose?

That Mary seems awfully nice and the clothes she has on sale are great! If @@.e;Etta@@ plays her cards right, she might even get a discount! Send her to &lt;&lt;choice [[Rainbow Boutique|Rainbow]]&gt;&gt;.

It’s a quaint little shop, compact and full of character. Clothes hang from railings all around the walls and from wheeled stands dotted across the floor. It’s the sort of place you could dig around in for hours. The proprietor, Mary, is sitting behind the counter, busy with her knitting. She looks up and smiles warmly, her wrinkles deepening. She’s a kind looking woman with silver hair cut into a stylish bob. Her clothing is a little demure, a pale blue knitted cardigan and a grey knee length skirt, but it’s clear that this is a woman of style; she must have been quite the knockout in her youth.

 @@.ma;Hello again, dear@@, she says. @@.ma;Have you thought about the job@@?

@@.e;Well@@, says @@.e;Etta@@. @@.e;It@@’@@.e;s such a lovely little shop@@. She starts on about how it’s just the sort of place she’d shop herself if she had the money: not too big and flashy but unique enough to draw some real appeal.

She made the clothes while he handled the business side of things. @@.ma;But we all know who was really in charge@@, she adds with a wink. Unfortunately Ken had a stroke and died a few years ago, leaving the shop in her care. @@.ma;Times aren@@’@@.ma;t as lucrative as they once were but I@@’@@.ma;m living well within my means@@.

The old lady gives her a final squeeze and @@.e;Etta@@ can feel the surprising bulge of her breasts hidden underneath her cardigan.

It’s almost lunch time so the place is absolutely jam packed with customers. Their chatter, mixing with the squawks of mewling babies, fills the air, intermittently drowned out by the hiss of the milk steamer and the whir of the coffee grinder. She wonders if it’s always this busy. She’ll certainly have her work cut out for her in a place like this! Unsure of where to go and who to speak to she joins the queue.

When it’s her turn the man working at the till slams a tray onto the counter. @@.ar;What can I get you@@? he asks flatly.

@@.ar;Well@@, @@.ar;what sort of experience can you bring to Spirella@@’@@.ar;s then@@?

She swallows. If she’d have known it was going to be like this she’d have chosen to go with the Rainbow Boutique. Not one to give up without a fight, however, she prepares to make her case. She tells Archie that she’s never had a proper job before because she thought it was best to focus on her studies at school and college. He jots something else in his notebook.

She definitely wasn’t expecting to complete her task so quickly so she’s got plenty of time left over before she should start thinking about getting herself back home.

As she’s browsing, the thought of having her own money occurs to her. She starts to think of all the possibilities, of all the things she’ll be able to afford. Of course she’s still going to contribute at home, but she’s bound to have some money left over for herself, right?

@@.e;Something like that@@. @@.e;Etta@@ can’t help but look at her teacher’s chest, following the perfect curves of each breast swelling beneath her top until they burst out of the shadowy valley of her cleavage. @@.t;Miss Timms@@ must have noticed because she pulls up at the neck of her top, attempting to hide her cleavage but succeeding only in hoisting her breasts a little higher, crushing the ample flesh against her body. @@.e;Etta@@ averts her eyes but not before catching an eyeful of heaving boob-flesh and the hint of a lacey black bra.

Thankfully she doesn’t seem to have minded because she smiles and says, @@.t;I@@’@@.t;m glad I ran into you@@, @@.t;actually@@. @@.t;Remember that help group I told you about@@?

After nearly fainting with shock, she returns the embrace. Even with such an obviously friendly hug, it feels unimaginably sexy to have her busty teacher&#x27;s body against hers.

What is the use of knowing something like that when she can’t even face talking to her? Oh well, at least she got a job, meaning the day wasn’t a total failure. That’s what she came out for, right? Not to score a date with her damn teacher. There will be other opportunities for that. @@.e;Etta@@ rings the bell when the bus nears her stop and gets off.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;
Approaching the house she sees @@.mo;Molly@@’s car in the driveway; she must be back early from work. @@.e;Etta@@ bounds up to the house, already excited to share her news with her family.

@@.e;What are you doing down there@@? @@.e;Is now not a good time@@?

&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;
@@.mo;Molly@@ is sitting on her bed looking out of the window. She’s wrapped in a towel, having obviously just finished in the shower, her hair held up in a tight bun. She hasn’t noticed @@.e;Etta@@ so far and appears to be lost in her own world.

@@.e;Hey@@, says @@.e;Etta@@.

@@.mo;Molly@@ turns, startled, but her expression softens to a smile as soon as she sees her little @@.e;sister@@.

@@.e;You OK@@, @@.e;Mol@@?

@@.mo;Molly@@ shoulders lift as she takes in a deep chest full of breath. She holds it for a moment before exhaling slowly. @@.mo;Yeah@@, she says. @@.mo;A long day@@, @@.mo;that@@’@@.mo;s all@@.

@@.e;Etta@@ sits next to her and puts an arm around her shoulder. It’s been quite some time since she got to see @@.mo;Molly@@. She only got back from her holiday with @@.j;Jules@@ a few nights ago and they haven’t had much time to catch up since. &lt;&lt;if $mollydiary is &quot;read&quot;&gt;&gt;Having read her diary, @@.e;Etta@@ knows all about what happened between her @@.mo;sister@@ and @@.j;Jules@@. @@.mo;Molly@@ is clearly deeply troubled by the complicated state of affairs that exists between the two women, but now is not the time for @@.e;Etta@@ to reveal that she is privy to such knowledge.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;There’s something bothering @@.mo;Molly@@, that much is for certain.

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;
@@.e;Etta@@ tells @@.mo;Molly@@ about her job at $job1. &lt;&lt;if $timmshome is &quot;known&quot;&gt;&gt; She very nearly goes on to say about how she found out that @@.t;Miss Timms@@ does in fact live about a lingerie store, but quickly thinks better of it. For one, @@.mo;Molly@@ doesn’t know who she is, and, probably more importantly, @@.e;Etta@@ doesn’t want her to get the wrong idea, whatever that may be.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;She very nearly goes on to mention her meeting with @@.t;Sophie@@ but quickly remembers that @@.mo;Molly@@ won’t actually have any idea who she’s talking about. Maybe they’ll meet on Monday, depending on how long the meeting goes on for? Time will tell.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

@@.mo;Nice one@@, @@.mo;Ett@@! She seems genuinely pleased for you. @@.mo;This definitely calls for a celebration@@. @@.mo;When do you start@@?

@@.e;None so far@@!

@@.mo;In that case you@@’@@.mo;re coming with me to the gym@@!

@@.e;Etta@@’s expression must be clear because @@.mo;Molly@@ bursts out laughing.

@@.mo;Relax@@, @@.mo;sis@@, she says. @@.mo;I@@’@@.mo;m not thinking about exercise@@. @@.mo;I@@’@@.mo;m talking spa day@@! @@.mo;Massages@@, @@.mo;saunas@@, @@.mo;the lot@@!

Inside the Progenitor’s body a clutch of eggs is growing. Within these eggs lie the tiny embryonic forms of hundreds of drone-bugs. The simplest form of all the aliens&#x27; many possible incarnations, these creatures will form the bedrock, the foundation, of @@.e;Etta@@’s brood. But @@.e;Etta@@’s body is not yet ready for those eggs. Before they can be laid inside her, she needs to be fertilised, her fallow soils tilled. In her current state, the eggs would lie dormant inside her and she would remain nothing but mere carrier. If the eggs are to gestate and mature properly, the Progenitor needs to make a few changes to her body. Nothing catastrophic, not at this point anyway, just a few minor adjustments that will give her the capability to nourish the eggs that will soon be laid within her body. To do this it must implant a number of microscopic organisms inside her. Tiny, but infinitely complex, these worm-like beings will act as genetic engineers and radically transform @@.e;Etta@@’s reproductive potential, turning her from barren carrier to hyper-fertile brood mother. The process, swift and painless as it is, will escape her awareness entirely, until the work is done and she has to discharge waste materials, that is. By that point, however, her will should be broken. The Progenitor opens its snout, its long tentacular tongue protruding slowly; [[it is time|insem1]]. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="111" name="dinner2" tags="" position="2564,1548">@@.m;Goodness me@@, groans @@.m;Helen@@. @@.m;I don@@’@@.m;t think I could manage another mouthful@@.

@@.mo;Me neither@@, says @@.mo;Molly@@, followed by a loud belch. She pats her stomach and says, @@.mo;pardon me@@.

@@.e;Etta@@ is lounging in the armchair with her feet up on the table, while her @@.mo;sister@@ and @@.m;mother@@ are on the sofa. @@.mo;Molly@@ is laying down with her head on the older woman’s lap. 

For some time now they’ve been talking about their lives. @@.mo;Molly@@ has spoke a bit about her holiday with @@.j;Jules@@ but seems awfully reticent when pressed for detail. &lt;&lt;if $mollydiary is &quot;read&quot;&gt;&gt;@@.e;Etta@@, of course, knows the reason for this. She can see that @@.mo;Molly@@ is clearly hurting.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Something&#x27;s obviously bothering her, but nobody can force her to talk about it if she doesn’t want to&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;.

So far the Progenitor has done little to dampen the inhibitions of the host animal. If it tried to infest her in her present state she would likely wake and put up a hard fight; a being of her size and strength could easily inflict mortal damage upon its delicate body. Although there is still time to influence her, it needs to plant the worms inside her right away. The eggs already developing inside its swollen body need to be placed within her womb tomorrow or they will shrivel and die.

It injects a heavy dose of sedatives into her bloodstream; now even the most violent interruptions will not wake her. As she sinks deeper and deeper into slumber, the Progenitor’s tongue reaches her pussy. It waits for a moment as from the tip beads a thick green fluid, lubrication for its unaided entry. Moving slowly and carefully to avoid causing damage, the Progenitor pushes its sticky appendage into @@.e;Etta@@’s vaginal opening. The host doesn’t stir for an instant; she lies dreaming, totally unaware of the invasion between her thighs. 

Deep inside her cunt, the Progenitor’s phallic tongue has met the wall of her cervix. To penetrate this formidable barrier it begins to secrete a powerful muscle relaxant. After some minutes it detects a slackening in @@.e;Etta@@’s body and soon the cervix opens to allow its uninvited guest. Stretching the walls of her vagina, the Progenitor pushes its tongue further and further until it has reached its destination: the womb. 

A bulge passes along the length of the tongue, squeezing through the narrow passage of the birth canal until it bursts in a flood of viscous green goo. The goo sloshes into the host&#x27;s empty womb, quickly filling the unused space. With no time to lose, the miniscule worms, carried along by the flow, get to work on their new surroundings. They burrow into the surrounding flesh, infiltrating deep inside the intimacy of the host’s cells. The Progenitor keeps pumping, sending load after load of the worm-laden goo into @@.e;Etta@@’s womb. Already affected by the work of the worms, her belly gradually expands, the skin stretching and rising in a bump  that slowly lifts the duvet that rests over her body. Soon she is full up, her worm-infested belly a veritable pot. Now empty, the Progenitor withdraws its tongue, the appendage leaving @@.e;Etta@@’s pussy with a loud slurp. Almost instantly she begins to ooze, excess goo leaking out of her body in a dark-green cream pie. Her cervix quickly clamps back shut, sealing her closed and locking the parasites inside.

It’s job complete, the Progenitor enters a rest state. Unaware of the creatures that now infest her womb, @@.e;Etta@@ continues to snore, her swollen belly rising like a hillock under the duvet. Deep inside her the aliens are hard at work, rewriting her genetic code, and also her destiny.

@@.e;Etta@@&#x27;s infestation [[level|Status]] has changed.

&lt;&lt;set $pchar.womb to &quot;@@.i;The Progenitor has infested Etta while she was sleeping and her womb is absolutely brimming with microscopic worm organisms. These tiny creatures will prepare her for the many eggs to come@@.&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $pchar.cor lt 8&gt;&gt;
At this stage in its mission the Progenitor has made decent progress in breaking the inhibitions of its host. By tomorrow evening, if it carries on at this rate, @@.e;Etta@@ will have become a fully compliant breeding machine, enslaved to the will of the hive; she will gladly volunteer her body for the carrying of future generations and even aid in the infestation and enslavement of her family and friends. All of that, however, lies in the future. The Progenitor still has much work to do. If it is to lay the eggs inside @@.e;Etta@@ tomorrow evening then it needs to lay the groundwork right away.

The phallic tongue slides between @@.e;Etta@@’s plump butt-cheeks, reaching upwards to the opening of her snatch. Her eyelids flicker open as she wakes. The Progenitor, however, is not alarmed by this new development; indeed it was to be expected. In her sleepy state, @@.e;Etta@@ is barely aware of what is happening, only of a growing pleasure as something thick and slimey squeezes between her thighs. She obliges, allowing her legs to be parted, moaning ever so softly as the Progenitor’s tongue slips between her wet lips. It pushes inside, meeting next to no resistance from the naturally lubricated hole. @@.e;Etta@@’s pussy is tight, clearly unused to such large visitors, but it gives way as from the tip of the tongue flows a potent muscle relaxant. 

Deep inside her cunt, the Progenitor’s phallic tongue has met the wall of @@.e;Etta@@’s cervix. Penetrated for the first time, she moans and snakes a languid hand down to her clit. As she sleepily jills herself, her cervix loosens and the tongue slips inside. @@.e;Etta@@ is by now fully awake but she’s so overcome with her own desire that she doesn’t for a moment stop. With one hand on her bare breast and the other fingering her clitty, she is sublimely unaware of her impending infestation. Stretching the walls of her vagina, the Progenitor pushes that tongue further and further until it has reached its destination: the womb.

A fat bulge passes along the length of the tongue imbedded inside, squeezing through the narrow passage of her birth canal. The feeling of her pussy swelling with the added volume is too much for @@.e;Etta@@ and she comes hard. Inside her the bulge bursts into her womb in a flood of viscous green goo. The goo sloshes into the empty space, quickly filling her up. With no time to lose, the miniscule worms, carried by the flow, get to work on their new surroundings. They burrow into surrounding flesh, infiltrating the intimacy of the host’s cells. The Progenitor keeps pumping, sending load after load of the worm-laden goo into @@.e;Etta@@’s womb. Already affected by the work of the worms, her belly gradually expands, pushing her arms away until she can no longer reach her clit. By this point it doesn’t matter; @@.e;Etta@@ is practically insensate, her body shaking with orgasmic bliss with every fresh load of goo pumped inside her. Soon she is full up, her worm-infested belly now a veritable pot. Finally empty, the Progenitor withdraws its tongue, leaving @@.e;Etta@@’s pussy with a loud slurp. Almost instantly she begins to ooze, excess goo leaking out of her body in a dark-green cream pie. Her cervix quickly clamps shut, sealing her new residents safely inside her.

It’s job complete, the Progenitor enters a rest state, while @@.e;Etta@@, exhausted by the storm of pleasure she has just weathered but unaware of the creatures that now infest her womb, also falls asleep, a content smile spread across her blood-flushed face. As she snores her swollen belly rises like a hillock under the duvet. Deep inside her the aliens are hard at work, rewriting her genetic code, and also her destiny.

@@.e;Etta@@&#x27;s infestation [[level|Status]] has changed.

&lt;&lt;set $pchar.womb to &quot;@@.i;Etta let the Progenitor pump her full of worm-laced goo. Her womb is now heavily infested; she&#x27;s going to have a hard time hiding that bump@@!&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $pchar.cor gte 8&gt;&gt;
At this stage in its mission the Progenitor has made considerable progress towards rendering @@.e;Etta@@’s inhibitions completely ineffective. By tomorrow evening, if it carries on at this rate, @@.e;Etta@@ will be a fully compliant breeding machine, devoted wholeheartedly to the will of her lover, the hive; she will lovingly offer up her body for the carrying and birthing of many future generations and even aid in the infestation and corruption of her family and friends. All of that, however, lies in the future. The Progenitor still has much work to do. If it is to lay the eggs inside @@.e;Etta@@ tomorrow evening then it needs to lay the groundwork right away.

The tentacle slips between @@.e;Etta@@’s plump butt-cheeks, tickling around the rim her her anus along the way, and reaches upwards to the opening of her snatch. Her eyelids flicker open as she wakes, but the expression of stunned shock soon gives way to one of hopeful expectation. The Progenitor, however, is not alarmed by this new development; indeed it was about to wake her itself. @@.e;Etta@@ has proven a willing host and, therefore, deserves compensation. It injects her with a stimulant and in a matter of seconds she is wide awake and hungry with lust. She groans and moans, obediently opening her legs wide as the tongue thrashes between her thighs. The Progenitor doesn’t know if @@.e;Etta@@ knows what the result of their coupling will entail, but it will not do to pass up what she is offering willingly. A brief inspection of her pussy reveals that she is wet and ready, her engorged lips glistening with girly lubricants. Wasting no more time the Progenitor plunges inside her, battering its way into her pussy with a firm thrust. @@.e;Etta@@ bucks and lets out a cry. Her virgin cunt is tight, clearly not used to admitting such sizable visitors, but it gives way as from the tip of the tongue flows a potent muscle relaxant. 

Conscious of the host&#x27;s needs and desires, the Progenitor pumps its tongue in and out of her, each thrust penetrating further inside her until the blunt tip bumps against the wall of her cervix. @@.e;Etta@@ holds her legs back and bites on her duvet as the rampant fucking gets harder and harder; her vaginal muscles relax from the effects of the alien’s powerful secretions and her cervix loosens to finally admit the tentacle even deeper. Overcome as she is with desire, it’s not pain she feels, but pleasure. As the walls of her vagina stretch to admit the base of the tongue’s greater girth, she tosses her head back and forth, muttering incoherent obscenities. With one final push the Progenitor has reach its destination: the womb.

@@.e;Etta@@ looks up to see a colossal bulge travelling along the length of the tentacle imbedded in her cunt. She clambers awkwardly to her knees and grips the turgid appendage with both hands, yanking with all her might. Recognising this behaviour as a product of animal-lust, the Progenitor does not fight. Instead, it pumps harder and the resulting blast catches @@.e;Etta@@ square in the face; caught open mouthed, she has no choice but to swallow the sticky load. The goo feels warm as it slides down her throat and soon she is hungrily lapping up the leftovers. Recognising the interior of their host, and immune to the acidity of her stomach, the worms carried along by the sludge immediately get to work. It might not be her womb they&#x27;ve found themselves but there is work they can do here. @@.e;Etta@@ reaches back, cooling goop dripping lewdly from her chin, and attempts to insert the tongue back into her pussy. Spurred on by her wild abandon, however, the Progenitor has other ideas. 

@@.e;Etta@@’s eyes widen as she feels the tentacle barge its way into her anus in one powerful thrust. She clamps a hand over her mouth to suppress her groans as the the tentacle begins to infiltrate her bowels; she can feel it moving inside her, tunnelling deep into the maze of her gut. She places her hand flat against her belly, shocked and more than a little excited to detect the motion of her body&#x27;s unnatural invader. Deep inside her, the tentacle is shooting gouts of worm-goo into her gut, infesting her from the inside. As good as any womb, this dark and warm place will be an excellent places for vulnerable eggs to mature and grow. Soon the Progenitor&#x27;s supplies are exhausted. @@.e;Etta@@ shudders in never-before-felt bliss as the tongue is pulled from its lodgings in her butt with an almost romantic care. It leaves her feeling well-used but content. She flops forward onto her bed, feeling the gaping emptiness of her now unplugged sphincter.

Its job complete, the Progenitor enters a resting state. Not aware of the creatures that now infest her stomach and bowels, @@.e;Etta@@ languishs in post-coital exhaustion, her body messy with sweat and drying sludge. Deep within her the worms are hard at work, rewriting her genetic code, and also her destiny. Before long she is asleep, her fucked-out body deserving of a long break.

@@.e;Etta@@&#x27;s infestation [[level|Status]] has changed.

&lt;&lt;set $pchar.belly to &quot;@@.i;Etta&#x27;s gut is teeming with alien life. Although intendedfor her womb, the worms are hard at work preparing her gut for eggs; warm and moist, this place is as good as any womb. Her belly is swollen into a soft mound@@.&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;set $pchar.stomach to &quot;@@.i;After swallowing a considerable helping of the Progenitor&#x27;s load, Etta has a stomach full of worm goo. Anything if not versatile, the organisms are already hard at work preparing the space for future impregnation@@.&quot;&gt;&gt;
